<p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plas
<p style="font-size: 25px; >The Solar System </p>
  <p> The solar system is a complex with 8 planets and 5 dwarf planets. It has a star which is the center of the solar system. Without it, we would not be here!!</p>
   <img src=" images.jpg" width="500">
<p> The Sun has gravity whch pulls everything together keeping it in a forever lasting circle. It's like the Sun on a
  fabric sheet with people holding each sides and the Sun in the middle and because it is heavier, the Earth obits
  around the sun as it is lighter . The sun does this with every planet. Infact, all the planets in the
  solar system and everything else apart from the Sun, makes up 2% of the mass of the solar system whereas the Sun makes
  98% of the mass. WOW!!</p>

<p> We have so many constellations, but the ones we know are the ones we see in the sky. There are 88 different ones in
  the sky. Here are some famous. </p>
<ul>
  <p style="text-align: left;"> - Orion (The Hunter) </p>

  <h1>What Does Magnatude Mean With Stars?</h1>
</u>


<p>The magnitude of a star is the brightness of a star. The lower the number, the brighter the star is! But, this can
  also be tested on any object in the sky. The magnitude of the Sun from Earth is -26.74. The brightest star in the
  night sky (other than the sun) is Sirus A. It has a magnatude of -1.46. The brightest planet is Venus - with a
  magnitude typically of -2.1 to -6.5. It is so btight that it can be very faintly be seen in the day time when the sun
  is out! Lastly, the Moon is also very bright - infact it is the second brightest object from Earth. It has an apparent
  magnitude of -14.7 at a full Moon, -9.9 at a half Moon and about +9.8 at a New Moon.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There are also loads of stars as well. Here are some of the brightest stars:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> - Vega - + 0.03
<p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> - Rigel - + 0.01
<p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> - Betelgeuse - + 0.58
<p> 
<p style="text-align: left;"> - Alpha Centauri - - 0.01

<p style="text-align: middle;">
<h2> Here is a chart of the magnitude of interstellar objects:</h2>

<p style=It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun). It must be big enough to have enough gravity to
  force it into a spherical shape. It must be big enough that its gravity has cleared away any other objects of a
  similar size near its orbit around the Sun. ;"><img src="images.png" width="320px">

<p> Now, lets look into our Solar System again and look at all 8 planets!</p>

<p> There are 8 very different worlds which are classified as planets. We will go them in order from the Sun </p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> Mercury:
<p style="text-align: left;">- Is the smallest planet in the solar system
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a diameter of 4,879
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature normally ranging from about 800 degrees at midday to around 180 degrees
  at night
<p style="text-align: left;">- a day typically lasting 59 days and a year being 88 days </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Venus:
<p style="text-align: left;">- Is the second planet from the Sun
<p style="text-align: left;"> - Has a diameter of 12,104 </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature of 462 degrees
<p style="text-align: left;"> - Has a day lasting 243 days and a year of 225 days

<p style="text-align: left;"> Earth:
<p style="text-align: left;">- Is the biggest rocky and inner planet in the solar system
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a diameter of 12,742
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature normally ranging from about 800 degrees at midday to around 180 degrees
  at night
<p style="text-align: left;">- a day typically lasting 24 hrs days and a year lasting 365/6 days

<p style="text-align: left;"> Mars:
<p style="text-align: left;">- Is the smallest planet in the solar system
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a diameter of 4,879
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature normally ranging from about 800 degrees at midday to around 180 degrees
  at night
<p style="text-align: left;">- a day typically lasting 24.7 hrs days and a year lasting 610 days

<p style="text-align: left;"> Jupiter:
<p style="text-align: left;">- Is the biggest planet in the solar system
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a diameter of 144,491km
<p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature average of -110
<p style="text-align: left;">- a day typically lasting 12 hrs hours and a year lasting 12 yaers (4331 days) days

<p style="text-align: left;"> Uranus:
  <p style="text-align: left;">- Is a blue world with 17 moons 
  <p style="text-align: left;">- Has a diameter of around 51,000km
  <p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature average of -320
  <p style="text-align: left;">- a day typically lasting 17 hrs hours and a year lasting 84 years (30,687 days) 

    <p style="text-align: left;"> Neptune:
      <p style="text-align: left;">- Is a is a windy world with 14 moons and 13 rings 
      <p style="text-align: left;">- Has a diameter of around 49,000km
      <p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature average of -353
      <p style="text-align: left;">- a day typically lasting 16 hrs hours and a year lasting 165 years (60,190 days)

       <h2><p> Now For The Dwarf Planets: </p></h2>

        <p style="text-align: left;"> Ceres:
          <p style="text-align: left;">- Is located in the astroid belt between jupiter and Mars. It is the smalllest dwarf planet.
          <p style="text-align: left;">- Has a diameter of around 950km
          <p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature average of -225
          <p style="text-align: left;">- a day typically lasting 16 hrs hours and a year lasting 165 years (60,190 days) 

            <p style="text-align: left;"> Pluto:
              <p style="text-align: left;">- Is located in beyond Neptune classyfying it as a TNO (Trans Neptunian Object)
              <p style="text-align: left;">- Has a diameter of around 49,000km
              <p style="text-align: left;">- Has a temperature average of -353
              <p style="text-align: left;">- a day typically lasting 16 hrs hours and a year lasting 165 years (60,190 days) 
  <p style="text-align: left;"> Why is Pluto Now Classified as a Dwarf Planet?
    A an object must have must have these three rules to become a planet:</p>
</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"> - It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> - It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> - It must be big enough that its gravity has cleared away any other objects of a similar
  size near its orbit around
  the Sun.</p>
